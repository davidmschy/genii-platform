DNS STATUS UPDATE
=================

? DNS CONFIGURED:
www.geniinow.com ? litigation-handled-professor-administrator.trycloudflare.com

??  ISSUE: Cloudflare Tunnel blocks custom domains
The free tunnel only works with the random subdomain it generates.
When you visit www.geniinow.com, it returns 403 Forbidden.

SOLUTIONS TO MAKE WWW.GENIINOW.COM WORK:
========================================

Option 1: Cloudflare Account (Proper Setup)
-------------------------------------------
1. Create/login to Cloudflare account
2. Add geniinow.com to Cloudflare
3. Create "Named Tunnel" (not quick tunnel)
4. Configure DNS in Cloudflare dashboard
5. Install cloudflared with authentication

Benefits:
- Works with custom domain
- SSL automatically
- Permanent URL
- Better performance

Option 2: Railway (Easiest)
---------------------------
1. Deploy to Railway (I can do this)
2. Add custom domain in Railway dashboard
3. Point geniinow.com to Railway

Benefits:
- No tunnel complexity
- Built-in custom domain support
- Automatic SSL
- Easier management

Option 3: VPS Deploy (Best Control)
-----------------------------------
Deploy directly to your server (104.248.214.4):
- Full control over DNS
- No tunnel needed
- Best performance
- Need SSH access

CURRENT STATUS:
==============
? DNS: www.geniinow.com configured
? Site: Working on tunnel URL
??  Custom domain: Blocked by tunnel

WORKING URL:
===========
https://litigation-handled-professor-administrator.trycloudflare.com

The site is LIVE with luxury enterprise design.
Custom domain needs one of the solutions above.
