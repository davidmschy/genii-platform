REVENUE MODEL FOR LANDING PAGE:

Why We Win When You Win:

Genii makes money three ways:
1. Monthly SaaS fee (fair, transparent)
2. Outcome fees (we win when AI generates revenue for you)
3. Service commissions (we get affiliate fees from tools you need)

This means:
? No hidden fees
? We are incentivized to make your AI successful
? You only pay more when you earn more
? We recommend the best tools (not most expensive)

Example Customer (Growth Plan):
